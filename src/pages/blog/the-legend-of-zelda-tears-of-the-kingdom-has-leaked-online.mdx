**[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.fr/Jeux/Jeux-Nintendo-Switch/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-1576884.html)** has leaked online. The most anticipated game of the year is the victim of a leak a few days before its launch

## Nintendo victim of one of its biggest leaks

It is true that the Japanese firm **Nintendo** is facing a difficult period following the leak of some copies of its highly anticipated game, "Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", on the 4chan forum, before the release date scheduled for the _12 May 2023_. Indeed, the long-awaited Zelda Tears of the Kingdom **has apparently been hacked**, thus finding itself revealed on video by many unscrupulous streamers. This situation embarrassed Nintendo, as the company had taken all necessary measures to keep the game's plot a secret while **showing off some of the new features** through the long presentation video presented by Eiji Aonuma in person.

Unfortunately, **several important plot details of the game, or even the entire game**, have leaked online. This leak not only disappointed fans of the franchise, but it also led to less surprise when the game was officially released.

For Nintendo, this situation is worrying because it could negatively **impact the game's sales**, as well as its **reputation as a video game developer**. However, Nintendo is known for its expertise in creating high-quality video games, and it is highly likely that the company will find ways to overcome this difficulty and regain the trust of its fans.

## A disaster for Nintendo

Indeed, this leak seriously jeopardizes Nintendo's plans for the release of "Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", the highly anticipated sequel to "Zelda Breath of The Wild" released in 2017. It is understandable that Nintendo is taking measures to avoid that spoilers do not spread on the Internet and spoil the surprise for players.

According to information reported by Kotaku, Nintendo is already **taking action by shutting down the biggest Discord servers dedicated to The Legend of Zelda leaks**. Nintendo's legal department is also on the alert to prevent the spread of spoilers. It's important that players respect Nintendo's efforts by avoiding looking for information on sites like 4chan, where key information is shared unscrupulously.

It is essential to point out that releasing spoilers may not only spoil the gaming experience, but also cause financial damage to the developer company. **Players should patiently wait for the official release of the game and avoid seeking unauthorized information that may have negative consequences for the entire gaming community.**

## How to survive without getting spoiled for 10 days ?

It's a shame that copies of the "Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" game were leaked before the scheduled release date. This risks spoiling the surprise for fans who have been waiting for this highly anticipated sequel to "Zelda Breath of The Wild".

Nintendo is taking matters into their own hands to prevent spoilers from spreading across the internet. Their legal department is working hard to prevent information from leaking out before the game is officially released.

If you are a fan of the franchise and want to keep the surprise, I advise you to **hide the keywords related to "Tears of the Kingdom" and "Zelda" on social networks** or **to limit your presence on these platforms** until to May 12, the game's official release date.

Remember that disclosing spoilers can harm the game experience, but also the creators and their creative work. **So respect their work by not sharing unauthorized information or spoilers before the game is officially released.** 

Finally, if you want information about the game, **[trust official Nintendo source](https://www.nintendo.fr/News/News-et-nouveautes-11145.html)** and avoid unauthorized forums and websites where information can be leaked without permission.
