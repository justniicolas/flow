## How does artificial image generation work?

Machine learning, a data analysis method, has a wide range of applications including image recognition, behavior prediction, data analysis, and more. Among the most popular tools of machine learning are **generative models**.

> **A generative model** is a machine learning method that generates new data from existing data. This method is often used in the synthesis of images, sounds and texts. Generative models are powerful tools for creating high-quality data for many applications.


There are different types of generative models, the most popular of which are **generative adversarial networks** (GANs), **variational autoencoders** (VAEs), and **diffusion models**.
<br/>
- **Generative Adversarial Networks** (GAN)

GANs use two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, to generate new images. The generator aims to create new images that resemble the original ones, while the discriminator classifies them as "true" or "false". The algorithm then selects images that look more "real", i.e. closer to the original data. This process helps to generate new high quality images that look real.

- **Variational auto-encoder** (VAE)

VAEs are also generative models that use a neural network to compress data and reconstruct it from this compressed representation. The VAE differs from other autoencoders by using a multivariate latent distribution for data compression. This method makes it possible to generate new images that are similar to the original ones while offering interesting variations.
In the following image, the 'code' section refers to the method used for compression.

<br/>
- **Broadcast Models**

Diffusion models add noise to the data and gradually remove detail before the neural network attempts to denoise the data. This method generates high quality images while eliminating unwanted noise.

Accordingly, there are various algorithms that can be used as well as many open source tools. We'll take a look at some of them and show some examples that were generated using these tools.

## Microsoft Designer now open to the public

Today released to the general public [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) the new graphic design tool from Microsoft
As a reminder, this type of platform allows users to generate an image that will be created from a prompt.

Since the announcement during the [Surface Event](https://news.microsoft.com/october-2022-news-event/) in October 2022, Canvas users have been curious to see the outcome of [Microsoft Designer]( https://designer.microsoft.com/), released today.
This new application is based on art-generating artificial intelligence, the same as for [DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2), which is a direct competitor.
For the moment, the public has access to a limited version, but in a very short period of time users with access to the [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/microsoft-365?rtc=1) will have access to a richer version.
<br/>
## What are the differences between Dall-E, Canvas and Microsoft Designer? 

This graphic design tool will allow you to create graphic creations to create content mainly. But today Microsoft offers new tools allowing support with social networks. We live in an era where social media (like UseFlow) is increasingly present and seeks better SEO and Microsoft has understood this. This is why the new tool that accompanies graphic creation and a new text generation function to generate captions and hashtags to accompany the visuals. An animation function also allows you to create animated visuals, automatically applying backgrounds and dynamic text transitions thanks to artificial intelligence.

On this point [DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) is outdated but [Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) still has to fight to get users of [Canvas](https://www.canva.com/fr_fr/), which dominates the market because the company has just launched a series of new AI-powered creation tools. Microsoft still has work to do because many big firms are on the market and will fight to keep their place.
