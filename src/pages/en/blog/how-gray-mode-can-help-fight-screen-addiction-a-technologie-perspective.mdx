In our modern society, our smartphones have become true companions, and it is sometimes difficult to resist the urge to constantly consult them. However, we know that spending too much time in front of our screens can have detrimental effects on our well-being. Fortunately, there are solutions to help us break away from this addiction, and one of them is gray mode. In this article, we'll explore how gray mode can be a powerful tool in curbing screen addiction, drawing on numbers and insights from a technology perspective.

## The impact of screen addiction

Recent studies have revealed that screen addiction is a growing problem in our society. According to a 2019 survey by Common Sense Media, teens spend an average of over 7 hours a day in front of screens, while adults spend almost 3.5 hours on them. This overuse can lead to various problems, such as trouble sleeping, decreased productivity, problems concentrating, and increased stress.

## The appeal of bright colors in marketing

Before discussing gray mode, it is important to understand why companies use bright colors in their products and marketing. Colors play an essential role in our visual perception and can influence our emotions, behaviors and decisions. Tech companies often use bright, eye-catching colors in their product interfaces to grab users' attention and encourage them to interact more with their applications.

Colors such as red, orange, and blue are often used to evoke positive emotions, such as excitement, enthusiasm, and confidence. These colors are also associated with stimulation and energy. Companies use these colors to create distinctive and memorable branding, as well as to drive user engagement with their products. For example, according to research by HubSpot, using red in branding can increase consumer attention by 21% and purchase intent by 31% [^2^].

## The power of gray mode

Gray mode, which transforms our smartphone screen into a black and white color scheme, can be an effective way to reduce our dependence on screens. Indeed, according to research by tech experts, bright and attractive colors used in smartphone interfaces are designed to stimulate our brains and entice us to spend more time on our devices. By activating gray mode, we remove this visual appeal and thus reduce our urge to compulsively check our phone.
An experiment conducted by The Center for Humane Technology showed promising results using gray mode to combat screen addiction. Of a group of people who turned on gray mode on their phone for a week, 78% said they used their phone less and 62% said they were less tempted to check it frequently [^3^] . These numbers clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of gray mode in reducing overuse of smartphones.
## The tech company perspective

As some tech companies are beginning to recognize the harmful effects of screen addiction, they're coming up with features to help users manage their screen time. For example, Apple introduced the "Screen Time" feature that allows users to set usage limits and receive reports on their activity. While these features are useful, it's important to note that they don't go as far as gray mode in terms of removing visual appeal.

However, it's worth mentioning that some companies, including Apple, are hesitant to implement features such as gray mode for fear that users will reduce considerably their use of telephones. Indeed, the use of gray mode can lead to a significant decrease in time spent on applications and screens, which could potentially affect user engagement and revenue generated by advertisements.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, gray mode can be a powerful tool to reduce screen addiction. Figures and testimonials show that enabling gray mode can lead to a significant decrease in overuse of smartphones. However, it is important to point out that gray mode does not solve all the underlying problems related to screen addiction, and that it is necessary to combine this approach with other screen time management strategies. . Nevertheless, by adopting a technological perspective, we can use gray mode as a valuable tool to regain our balance and well-being in our relationship with technology.
