**In the digital age, the worrying issue of mass surveillance is emerging as one of the major issues. At the heart of this complex debate is Edward Snowden, whose career with the NSA and the CIA took a decisive turn in 2013. Driven by a deep ethical concern, Snowden chose to reveal to the world the occult methods used to exercise general surveillance over the entire planetary population.**

## Edward Snowden, Whistleblower
Edward Snowden and the Mass Surveillance Revelations: A Closer Look at the Impact, Methods and Global Debate

Edward Snowden, **an iconic figure in the privacy and surveillance debate**, has shaken the foundations of politics and technology by revealing the extent of mass surveillance orchestrated by the US government. Before becoming a **whistleblower**, he worked for the CIA and the NSA, acquiring an in-depth knowledge of intelligence operations.

**However, his ethical convictions and his concern for the protection of privacy compelled him to act**. In 2013, he fled the United States for Hong Kong and **began to leak confidential documents**, which exposed the NSA's mass surveillance activities. His **revelations exposed a complex network of sophisticated programs, designed to collect, analyze and exploit data from various sources**.

## PRISM, XKeyscore and Mass Surveillance

Among the programs revealed by Snowden, **the PRISM program** was one of the most significant. He exposed how the NSA had **access to data stored on the servers of tech giants** such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple. The PRISM program was just the tip of the iceberg.

**XKeyscore**, on the other hand, was a **powerful research tool allowing the NSA to filter and analyze huge amounts of data** in real time. This advanced search capability has raised concerns about privacy and individual liberty.

XKeyscore allowed analysts to **search for specific data**, using keywords, IP addresses or other data elements. The results of these searches could include **emails, browsing histories, chat messages** and much more. The real-time use of this tool has raised concerns about the **continuous monitoring of private communications.**

## Global Impact

To collect this data, the mass surveillance unveiled by Snowden relied on a range of complex technical methods. **Interception of communications via satellites and undersea communications cables enabled the NSA to spy on global communications.** Security flaws in computer software and systems were exploited to gain access to sensitive data , and collecting metadata made it possible to track communication patterns without necessarily accessing the actual content of messages.

**Countries around the world have been shocked by the extent of US surveillance, and diplomatic relationship were strained**. Citizens felt betrayed and worried about their privacy. The revelations have also catalyzed legislative reforms, prompting some countries to reassess their own surveillance practices.

Debate over the ethics of Snowden's role as a whistleblower continues to rage. Some consider him a hero who exposed the truth and paved the way for a vital debate about privacy and surveillance. Others see him as a traitor who endangered national security by leaking secrets.

## Impact on Privacy

Snowden's legacy lives on through current discussions of privacy and surveillance. His revelations have prompted governments and companies to rethink their data collection practices. New regulations and laws, such as **USA FREEDOM Act** have emerged, aimed at regulating the surveillance activities of governments and protecting individual rights.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Edward Snowden brought a new perspective to the debate on mass surveillance and privacy in the digital age. His courage and his revelations have led to significant changes in surveillance policies and in the way citizens perceive the protection of their data. Whether you consider him a hero, a whistleblower or a traitor, there is no doubt that the impact of his actions will be felt for many years to come.
