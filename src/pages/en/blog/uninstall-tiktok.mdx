This platform based on videos of a few seconds was able to attract a mainly young audience, arousing their curiosity and inviting them to express their creativity. However, behind this skyrocketing popularity lie troubling issues around user privacy and data security.**


## Why and how do people use TikTok?

TikTok is a social network consisting of watching short videos of a few seconds. In addition, like most social networks, TikTok has created a service, an algorithm that captures the user's attention, making the application more immersive for longer use. The longer you stay on the app, the more information TikTok has about what you like, which can be used for better targeting. Targeting is done through elements such as likes or comments on the home page, the "For You" category which quickly learns about you thanks to artificial intelligence which will analyze the time you spend on a video , if you comment, like or share it. As TikTok will recommend videos that the user likes, it will influence the user to stay on the platform, which can lead to smartphone addiction.
Even though TikTok's algorithm is formidable, the Chinese company sets up research on the different types of video categories such as first-person camera views, but also humor on key variables such as immersion and entertainment on the TikTok platform, again all relevant to extending the user's stay.

Several researches since the explosion of the platform have arisen, these relate to the use of TikTok and the theory of uses and gratification, which allows an approach that aims to understand why people use certain media or platforms.

A study by Bucknell Bossen and Kottasz reveals that the main driver influencing behaviors on TikTok is the gratification of entertainment and affection needs. In other words, users find satisfaction in consuming and interacting with entertaining content by establishing affectionate links with other users.
This gratification motivates different actions on TikTok, including passive content consumption, content creation, and interaction with other users. The authors also identified three specific motivations for using TikTok: expanding one's social network, seeking fame, and expressing oneself creatively.

Another study by Omar and Dequan shows the need to escape from everyday life or find an escape. It means that people are fanned by the platform for entertainment and escape from stress or routine.

In summary, these studies highlight that the motivations for using TikTok are linked to the gratification of entertainment and affection needs, as well as the search for escape, self-expression and the creation of social bonds. These factors influence the different behaviors of users on the platform.

## But why do we have to uninstall TikTok to preserve our privacy?

TikTok has been the target of media and governments over privacy concerns, ethnic filters, misuse of data, fight against forensics and security.
TikTok uses artificial intelligence to display personalized content to the user by analyzing user interests and preferences through interactions with app content. So concerns are emerging about the impact TikTok can have on users and society.
By analyzing TikTok APK one can find out that TikTok has permission to access internet, access network status, access camera, and read and write internal storage .
 
By analyzing the APK of TikTok a little more, one may discover that the videos and thumbnail images received from TikTok on the smartphone are not encrypted and could be easily sniffed on the network.

TikTok also uses fingerprinting techniques to identify users and track their activity on the app.
Thus TikTok collects a massive amount of information and the list is long... The Chinese company collects information: that the user shares with TikTok from third-party social network providers, as well as technical and behavioral information on the use of the application by the user; contained in the messages that users send via the application; the user's contacts if they authorize access to the telephone directory on the mobile; device IP address, location data, browsing history, cookies, mobile carrier, time zone setting, and mobile information including model, resolution , and the operating system. The application thus shares our data with business partners, advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve advertisements, cloud storage providers, data centers and IT service providers.

While privacy issues related to TikTok's possible storage of data on servers in China exist, much of the privacy issues seem to stem from its platform. A major concern comes from its increasingly young user base which is a lucrative target for the advertising industry. Concerns about the collection of personal information about children, cyberbullying, exposing children to sexual pretenders, pornographic content, â€¦ have also surfaced.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, TikTok has become extremely popular due to its entertaining content and its ability to satisfy its users' needs for escapism, self-expression and social connection. Motivations for using TikTok are primarily related to satisfying entertainment and affection needs, as well as seeking escape from the everyday.

However, despite its appeal, TikTok also raises serious concerns about the privacy and security of user data. Concerns have been raised about misuse of data, collection of personal information about children, and cyberbullying issues on the platform. Additionally, privacy concerns related to TikTok's possible storage of data on servers in China have been reported.

Due to these privacy concerns, some might consider uninstalling TikTok from their devices. Users should be aware of the potential risks associated with using this platform and take steps to protect their personal data and online safety.

In sum, TikTok provides an engaging entertainment experience and meets various user needs, but it is important to consider privacy issues carefully before deciding whether to continue using this app. Being aware of potential risks will help users make informed decisions about their use of TikTok and protect their privacy online.
