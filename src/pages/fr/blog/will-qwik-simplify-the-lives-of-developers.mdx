### Somes Words : 

- **Framework** : A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build and manage web applications, web services and websites.

- **The lazy loading** : Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.
Lazy loading can occur on different moments in the application, but it typically happens on some user interactions such as scrolling and navigation.

<br/>
## What is Qwik 

[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) is a Javascript-based web framework that shares many similarities with other frameworks commonly used by developers. However, Qwik's unique approach lies in how it achieves its goals, which is to delay the download and execution of Javascript. This is accomplished by selectively downloading and executing only the necessary code needed to complete the user's intended action, which is known as fine-grained **lazy-loading**. This approach represents a distinct method for building web applications.

## Why is delaying the execution of Javascript so important in the eyes of Qwik  
Delaying the execution of Javascript is cruciel to improve **the performance of modern websites**. Indeed, the use of large amounts of Javascript has become essential to make a websites **interactive** and **dynamic**. However, this excessive use of Javascript can lead to two major problems : **excessive consumption of network bandwidth** and **longer loading times**. These porblems have important **consequences for accessibility and user experience**, but they also have a considerable **financial impact** for companies. Studies have shown that **each 100 millisecond increase in page load time can lead to a conversion reduction of than 1%**. For companies, this can result in a significant loss of income.

<br/>

In addition, Javascript is **single threaded**, which means that it can only run on one thread at a time. This poses a problem for websites thaht become more and more complex over time. Indeed, they **cannot effectively exploit modern mutli-core processors** to speed up their execution. 

To solve the problems, it is recommanded **to delay the exection of Javascript** by using techniques such as **lazy loading**, **code optimization** or **cahcing**. This reduces the amount of Javascript initially **loaded and loads it gradually as the user interacts with the site**. In addition, it optimizes page loading time, improves the user experience and redecuces network bandwidth costs? All these methodes to delay the exectuion of Javascript,... that's why Qwik exists. 


## The problem of developer

Indeed, the **size of packages** is often a problem for developers when they follow best pratices for each tool used. This can slow down loading time and affect the user experience. 
To mitigate this problem, developpers often use lazy loading techniques, which consist of loading only the elements necessary for the initial displau of the page, and then gradually **loading the other elements as the user interacts with the site**. 
Qwick is designed to produce many pieces of lazy loading code. Its exectuion environment can divide the application into several lazy loading pieces, which are only downloaded when they are needed. **This reduces the size of the initial packages** and improves the overall performance of the site.

By using Qwik, developers can therefore **optimize loading time** and **user experiecne**, while respecting the best development practices. This can allow companies to remain competitive in the market by offering websites that are **faster**, **more efficient** and more user-friendly.
